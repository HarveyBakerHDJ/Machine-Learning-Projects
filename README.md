## Projects

### 1. Customer Purchase Prediction
- **Descriptions**: Preparing and importing a large customer dataset to perform linear regression (sklearn) as a way to predict future purchase amounts, including visualisation. 
- **Files**: 'linear_regression_with_customer_data.ipynb', 'linear_regression_with_customer_data.py'

### 2. 3 Diemensional Gradient Descent From Scratch
- **Descriptions**: Using Python, NumPy and Matplotlib.pyplot to perform gradient descent on a complex function with two input variables, including visualisation.
- **Files**: 'gradient_descent_from_scratch.ipynb', 'gradient_descent_from_scratch.py'

## Usage/Installation

To run these projects locally both Python and the necessary libraries will have to be installed, here are the steps all done in the CMD Terminal:

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/HarveyBakerHDJ/finance-projects.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd machine-learning-projects

3. Install the required libraries:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Each project contains a jupyter notebook .ipynb for use in jupyter notebook and a python script .py for running the models as a standalone script

4. To start a jupyter notebook and then open the desired file:
    jupyter notebook

5. To run the .py python script:
    python project_name.py
